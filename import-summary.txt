ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* proguard.cfg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => loveReader60\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* libs\activation.jar => loveReader60\libs\activation.jar
* libs\additionnal.jar => loveReader60\libs\additionnal.jar
* libs\armeabi\libmupdf.so => loveReader60\src\main\jniLibs\armeabi\libmupdf.so
* libs\itextpdf-5.4.1.jar => loveReader60\libs\itextpdf-5.4.1.jar
* libs\jxl.jar => loveReader60\libs\jxl.jar
* libs\mail.jar => loveReader60\libs\mail.jar
* libs\poi-3.7-20101029.jar => loveReader60\libs\poi-3.7-20101029.jar
* libs\poi-scratchpad-3.7-20101029.jar => loveReader60\libs\poi-scratchpad-3.7-20101029.jar
* res\ => loveReader60\src\main\res\
* src\ => loveReader60\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
